Docker solves the problem of "It works on my machine."


Docker lets you package your app with everything it needs (code, libraries, dependencies) into one container so it runs the same everywhere â€” on your computer, servers, or the cloud.

Docker vs Virtual Machine

Docker is a lightweight tool that runs applications in isolated environments using the host OS kernel, which makes it faster to start and more efficient with system resources.

Virtual machines run a full operating system using a hypervisor, providing strong isolation but requiring more resources like CPU and RAM.


Demo:-
>> docker pull hello world
>> docker run hello-world

Here, image means class and containers means objects.

Docker doemon: A process that runs in background always.

Using Ubuntu:-

>> docker pull ubuntu
>> docker run -it ubuntu

>> exit //to exit the system

Docker Network
It lets to container talk to each other without the need of IP address

>> docker network ls
>> docker network create mongo-network

>> docker run -d -p 27017:27017--name mongo -- network mongo-network -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin-e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=admin mongo

>> docker ps //image running
>> docker ps -a?? image stored

p-flag: port binding

//running mongo-express container on isolated network mongo-network

>> docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --name mongo-express --network mongo-network -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME=admin -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD=admin -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_URL="mongodb://admin:admi@mongo:27017" mongo-express
